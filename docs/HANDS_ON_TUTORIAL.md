# Solo Developer Tutorial

**Scenario**: Building a personal task management app with authentication and API integration.

**Focus**: Core Vybe functionality without team complexity

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize New Project
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:init "Personal task management app with user authentication, API integrations, and data export features"

# Expected behavior:
# - Creates .vybe/ directory structure
# - Generates foundation documents based on your description
# - Sets up staged outcome roadmap
# - Creates living documents you can edit freely
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does init create all required foundation documents?
- [ ] Are the generated documents specific to the project description?
- [ ] Do technology choices match the project requirements?
- [ ] Is the project context comprehensive enough for decision-making?

### Step 2: Review Foundation Documents
```bash
# 1. Review the generated documents
cat .vybe/project/overview.md        # Business context and goals
cat .vybe/project/architecture.md    # Technology stack and design  
cat .vybe/project/conventions.md     # Development standards
cat .vybe/project/outcomes.md        # Staged outcome roadmap

# 2. Edit documents if needed (optional)
# Use any editor to refine the generated content:
# nano .vybe/project/overview.md
# code .vybe/project/architecture.md

# Documents are living - edit freely, no approval needed!
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Are the generated documents comprehensive and specific to your project?
- [ ] Does the outcomes.md show a realistic staged roadmap?
- [ ] Do technology choices in architecture.md make sense?
- [ ] Can you easily identify the Stage 1 minimal outcome?

### Step 3: Generate Strategic Backlog
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:backlog init

# Generate outcome-grouped backlog with stage roadmap
# This creates strategic level "Task Overview" for each stage

# Review what was created:
cat .vybe/backlog.md

# Look for structure like:
# ## Stage 1: Basic Task Operations (1-2 days)
# #### Task Overview
# - [ ] Core task CRUD functionality
# - [ ] Simple local storage
# - [ ] Basic HTML interface
#
# ## Stage 2: User Authentication (2-3 days)  
# #### Task Overview
# - [ ] User registration/login
# - [ ] Personal task lists
# - [ ] Session management

# Note: These are HIGH-LEVEL overviews, not detailed implementation tasks
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does backlog show stages with "Task Overview" sections?
- [ ] Are stages organized from Stage 1 (minimal) to later stages?
- [ ] Do the Task Overview items match the outcomes.md roadmap?
- [ ] Is Stage 1 clearly the minimal viable functionality?
- [ ] Are later stages logical progressions from earlier ones?

## Phase 2: Feature Planning

### Step 4: Plan Stage 1 Implementation
```bash
# Create detailed specifications for Stage 1
/vybe:plan stage-1

# This takes the high-level "Task Overview" from backlog.md
# and creates detailed implementation specifications

# Review what was created:
ls .vybe/features/stage-1/
cat .vybe/features/stage-1/requirements.md    # Detailed EARS requirements
cat .vybe/features/stage-1/design.md         # Technical architecture
cat .vybe/features/stage-1/tasks.md          # Granular implementation tasks

# Example of what you might see in tasks.md:
# ## Sprint 1 (Days 1-2)  
# - [ ] Create HTML task list structure
# - [ ] Implement add task function
# - [ ] Add task completion toggle
# - [ ] Build local storage persistence
# - [ ] Style basic CSS layout
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does /vybe:plan stage-1 create detailed specs in .vybe/features/stage-1/?
- [ ] Are the tasks.md items much more detailed than backlog "Task Overview"?
- [ ] Do requirements.md capture specific acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Does design.md show technical approach for implementation?
- [ ] Are tasks granular enough for 1-2 day implementation?

### Step 5: Modify Stage 1 with AI Assistance (Optional)
```bash
# Test the --modify feature for AI-assisted changes
/vybe:plan stage-1 --modify "Change: Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript"

# This modifies the existing Stage 1 specifications:
# - Updates design.md with TypeScript considerations
# - Adjusts tasks.md for TypeScript setup and compilation
# - Modifies requirements as needed

# Review the changes:
cat .vybe/features/stage-1/design.md         # Should show TypeScript approach
cat .vybe/features/stage-1/tasks.md          # Should include TypeScript setup tasks

# Other examples of modifications:
# /vybe:plan stage-1 --modify "Add: Drag and drop for task reordering"
# /vybe:plan stage-1 --modify "Change: Use IndexedDB instead of localStorage"
# /vybe:plan stage-1 --modify "Remove: Advanced filtering features"
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does --modify successfully update existing Stage 1 specs?
- [ ] Are changes reflected across requirements, design, and tasks?
- [ ] Do modifications maintain consistency with project architecture?
- [ ] Can you make multiple types of changes (add, change, remove)?

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Workflow

### Step 6: Check Project Status
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:status

# Expected behavior:
# - Shows overall project progress and stage status
# - Displays planned stages and their completion status
# - Indicates current active stage (should be Stage 1)
# - Shows next recommended actions

# Example output might show:
# üéØ Project: Personal Task Management
# üìä Stage Progress: Stage 1 IN PROGRESS (0/5 tasks completed)
# üîÑ Active Stage: Stage 1 - Basic Task Operations
# üìã Next Action: /vybe:execute stage-1-task-1
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does status show staged outcome progression?
- [ ] Are planned stages clearly visible with status?
- [ ] Does it indicate which stage is currently active?
- [ ] Does it provide clear next steps for Stage 1?

### Step 7: Execute Stage 1 Implementation
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:execute stage-1

# This starts implementing the detailed tasks from stage-1/tasks.md
# Expected behavior:
# - Loads complete project context (all foundation docs)
# - Shows Stage 1 task list with current status
# - Guides implementation of specific tasks
# - Updates progress as tasks are completed

# Alternative: Execute specific tasks
# /vybe:execute stage-1-task-1    # Execute first task
# /vybe:execute stage-1-task-2    # Execute second task
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does execute load all project context before starting?
- [ ] Are Stage 1 tasks shown with clear guidance?
- [ ] Does the execution follow the detailed task breakdown?
- [ ] Is progress tracked and updated appropriately?

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance

### Step 8: Project Quality Audit
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:audit

# Expected behavior:
# - Checks alignment between foundation docs and stage specs
# - Identifies gaps in specifications or consistency issues
# - Validates stage progression makes sense
# - Shows project health and suggests improvements

# Example output might show:
# ‚úÖ Foundation documents complete and consistent
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Stage 1 tasks missing acceptance criteria
# ‚úÖ Stage progression logical (1‚Üí2‚Üí3)
# üí° Suggestion: Add TypeScript configuration to conventions.md
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does audit check consistency between different document types?
- [ ] Are identified gaps specific and actionable?
- [ ] Does it validate the staged outcome approach is working?
- [ ] Is it clearly different from /vybe:status (quality vs progress)?

### Step 9: Code-Reality Analysis Testing
```bash
# Test the new code-reality analysis modes:
/vybe:audit code-reality           # Compare docs vs actual implementation
/vybe:audit scope-drift            # Check if scope expanded beyond Stage 1
/vybe:audit documentation          # Sync project docs with actual progress

# Expected behavior:
# - Analyzes YOUR actual project files (not hardcoded examples)
# - Provides specific recommendations based on current state
# - Shows concrete gaps between documentation and reality
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Do audit modes analyze your actual project files?
- [ ] Are results specific to your project (no generic examples)?
- [ ] Do recommendations help align docs with reality?
- [ ] Would the output work well for CI/automation?

## Phase 5: Natural Language Help & Smart Routing

### Step 10: Test Natural Language Assistance
```bash
# Test various natural language requests:

# 1. Scope adjustment
/vybe:discuss "I only have 1 week instead of 2, what should I cut from Stage 1?"
# Expected: Routes to mvp-extraction + scope-drift analysis

# 2. Technical changes

## Key Testing Focus Areas

### Critical Command Distinctions
Pay special attention to these commonly confused command pairs:

**Status vs Audit (Most Important)**
- `/vybe:status` = Progress tracking ("How are we doing?")
- `/vybe:audit` = Quality assurance ("What needs fixing?")

**Plan vs Discuss**
- `/vybe:plan` = Create feature specifications
- `/vybe:discuss` = Natural language command assistance

**Execute vs Status**
- `/vybe:execute` = Do implementation work
- `/vybe:status` = Check progress and assignments

### Command Consistency Checks
Look for these potential issues:
- Parameter order inconsistencies (feature-first vs member-first)
- Unclear command naming (`member-count` vs `set-members`)
- Verbose syntax that could be simplified
- Missing useful shortcuts or aliases

---

# - Shows detected languages, frameworks
# - Shows complexity and template type
# - Indicates template is ready for --template usage
```

## Phase 3: Template-Driven Project Initialization

### Step 7: Initialize Project with Template DNA
```bash
/vybe:init "AI workflow orchestration platform for document processing and analysis" --template=genai-stack

# Expected behavior:
# - Template validation before proceeding
# - Load template context (metadata, mapping, generated docs)
# - Generate project docs using template as foundation
# - Activate template enforcement structures
# - Mark template as permanent project DNA
# - Create .vybe/project/.template file with template info

# Expected project structure:
# - Standard .vybe/project/ documents enhanced with template patterns
# - .vybe/enforcement/ rules active
# - .vybe/patterns/ templates ready for use
# - .vybe/validation/ rules enforcing template compliance
```

### Step 8: Verify Template Integration
```bash
# Check that template DNA is active
ls -la .vybe/

# Expected structure:
# - enforcement/ (template rules)
# - patterns/ (template code templates)
# - validation/ (template compliance rules)
# - project/.template (template DNA marker)
# - templates/genai-stack/ (template storage)

# Review project foundation
cat .vybe/project/.template

# Expected content:
# - template: genai-stack
# - template_set: [timestamp]
# - template_immutable: true
```

## Phase 4: Template-Guided Development

### Step 9: Template-Aware Feature Planning
```bash
/vybe:plan document-processing "Create workflow for processing and analyzing uploaded documents"

# Expected AI behavior:
# - Load template enforcement rules
# - Use template patterns for feature structure
# - Follow template's workflow/component organization
# - Generate specs that align with template architecture
# - Create tasks using template-specific patterns

# Test that planning follows template structure:
# - Should create features following template directory patterns
# - Should use template's component/service organization
# - Should reference template's workflow patterns
```

### Step 10: Template-Enforced Code Generation
```bash
/vybe:execute document-processing-task-1

# Expected AI behavior:
# - Load template patterns from .vybe/patterns/
# - Use template code templates for generation
# - Follow template enforcement rules for file placement
# - Generate code matching template conventions
# - Maintain template architectural consistency

# Verify code follows template:
# - Check file locations match template structure
# - Check naming follows template conventions
# - Check code patterns match template style
```

### Step 11: Template Compliance Validation
```bash
/vybe:audit

# Expected AI behavior:
# - Load template validation rules
# - Check project structure against template requirements
# - Validate naming conventions from template
# - Verify import patterns match template
# - Report any deviations from template standards

# Expected output:
# - Template compliance checking
# - Structure validation against template rules
# - Code pattern verification
# - Any violations of template DNA reported
```

## Phase 5: Template DNA Immutability Testing

### Step 12: Test Template Immutability
```bash
# Try to change template (should fail)
/vybe:init "Same project" --template=different-template

# Expected behavior:
# - Detect existing project with template DNA
# - Refuse to change template
# - Explain template immutability
# - Suggest migration approach if template change needed
```

### Step 13: Template-Guided Discussion
```bash
/vybe:discuss "How can I add real-time features to this workflow platform?"

# Expected AI behavior:
# - Consider template constraints and patterns
# - Suggest solutions that work within template architecture
# - Reference template's real-time capabilities if any
# - Propose implementation following template patterns
# - Maintain consistency with template DNA
```

## Phase 6: Template System Verification

### Step 14: Complete Template Workflow Test
```bash
# Test complete development cycle with template
/vybe:status          # Should show template-guided progress
/vybe:plan stage-2    # Should follow template patterns
/vybe:execute task-X  # Should use template code patterns
/vybe:audit          # Should validate template compliance
/vybe:release        # Should advance using template structure

# Verify template DNA maintained throughout:
# - All commands respect template patterns
# - Generated code follows template standards
# - Project structure remains template-compliant
# - Template cannot be changed mid-project
```

### Step 15: Template Migration Scenario
```bash
# Test template migration guidance
/vybe:discuss "This GenAI template is too complex, I want to switch to a simpler FastAPI template"

# Expected AI behavior:
# - Explain template immutability
# - Suggest creating new project with different template
# - Offer migration assistance strategy
# - Explain trade-offs and considerations
# - Provide step-by-step migration approach
```
