# Vybe Framework - Complete Hands-On Tutorial

A comprehensive table-top exercise walking through all Vybe commands from project initialization to completion. This tutorial simulates real development workflows to test command consistency and identify potential improvements.

**Note**: Commands use performance-optimized intelligent analysis. Phase 1 provides immediate intelligent setup (~30 seconds), while Phase 2 enhances with comprehensive research in background (2-5 minutes). You get fast feedback with same final quality.

## Prerequisites & Setup

Before starting any tutorial, you need to set up your environment properly based on whether you're testing solo or team features.

### Repository Requirements

# Multi-Member Tutorial

**Scenario**: Building an e-commerce platform called "ShopFlow" with a 3-developer team.

**Participants**: 
- dev-1: Backend specialist (authentication, payments)
- dev-2: Frontend specialist (UI, product catalog)  
- dev-3: DevOps specialist (deployment, infrastructure)

**Focus**: Team coordination, assignment conflicts, multi-session workflows

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Team Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Team Project
```bash

# - Suggests rebalancing or fixes
```

**Test Points:**
- [ ] Does audit catch real team coordination problems?
- [ ] Are cross-developer consistency issues found?
- [ ] Do fix suggestions make sense for teams?

## Phase 5: Advanced Team Scenarios

### Step 9: Dynamic Team Changes
```bash
# Command to test:
/vybe:backlog member-count 4    # Add new developer mid-project

# Expected behavior:
# - Preserves existing assignments

## Key Testing Focus Areas

### Critical Command Distinctions
Pay special attention to these commonly confused command pairs:

**Status vs Audit (Most Important)**
- `/vybe:status` = Progress tracking ("How are we doing?")
- `/vybe:audit` = Quality assurance ("What needs fixing?")

**Plan vs Discuss**
- `/vybe:plan` = Create feature specifications
- `/vybe:discuss` = Natural language command assistance

**Execute vs Status**
- `/vybe:execute` = Do implementation work
- `/vybe:status` = Check progress and assignments

### Command Consistency Checks
Look for these potential issues:
- Parameter order inconsistencies (feature-first vs member-first)
- Unclear command naming (`member-count` vs `set-members`)
- Verbose syntax that could be simplified
- Missing useful shortcuts or aliases

**Ready to begin tutorial execution!**

This tutorial provides two comprehensive paths for testing the entire Vybe framework:

**ðŸ‘¤ Solo Tutorial** - 9 focused steps testing core functionality without team complexity
**ðŸ‘¥ Multi-Member Tutorial** - 10 steps testing team coordination and multi-session workflows  

Both tutorials emphasize the critical distinction between status (progress) and audit (quality) commands. Any inconsistencies, unclear commands, or workflow issues should surface during execution.
