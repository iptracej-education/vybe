# Vybe Framework

**Spec-driven agile-like development for Claude Code**

Vybe is a spec-driven framework for Claude Code that lets you plan and develop software in clear stages. It blends natural-language commands with a structured spec (backlog, features, tasks, releases) so AI remains flexible without causing drift between docs and code. Each stage produces a concrete outcome that strengthens the next planâ€”keeping scope, priorities, and artifacts aligned.

**Note:** *This is an experimental project under active development. Features and structure may change significantly.*

## Overview

Vybe brings structure to AI-assisted development through:
- **Specification-first workflow with backlog management** - Every feature starts with clear requirements and design in organized backlog
- **Incremental outcome approach** - Break projects into stages that deliver working units in days each
- **Multi-developer coordination** - Single session or multiple Claude Code sessions work together seamlessly  
- **Quality assurance** - Built-in gap detection and fix automation
- **Living documentation** - Specifications evolve with your code

## Key Features

- **9 core commands** - Complete development workflow: `template` (optional) â†’ `init` â†’ `backlog` â†’ `plan` â†’ `execute` â†’ `release` â†’ `status` â†’ `audit` â†’ `discuss`
- **Staged planning and execution** - First minimal outcome in 1-2 days, then progressive enhancement stages
- **Natural language scope adjustment** - Intelligent scope reduction for timeline constraints, plus guided expansion planning
- **Code-reality analysis** - Bridge gap between docs and actual code with intelligent analysis
- **Template integration (optional)** - Import production-ready templates as permanent project foundation with AI-guided pattern consistency
- **Member coordination** - Assign stages to dev-1, dev-2, etc. with conflict detection
- **Auto session handoff** - Automate session handoff when context windows get critically low  (<10%)

## Quick Setup

### Solo Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Create new project directory
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init

# 2. Install Vybe Framework (automated)
git clone https://github.com/iptracej-education/vybe.git
cd vybe && ./install.sh

# 3. Initialize your project with staged outcomes
/vybe:init "Your project description"
# This will interactively capture your first minimal outcome and final vision
```

### Manual Installation
If you prefer manual setup, see `docs/HANDS_ON_TUTORIAL.md` for step-by-step instructions.

### Multi-Member Team Setup
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repository first (required for team coordination)
# Go to GitHub and create: https://github.com/yourusername/your-project

# 2. Clone your empty repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
cd your-project

# 3. Install Vybe Framework (automated)
git clone https://github.com/iptracej-education/vybe.git
cd vybe && ./install.sh && cd ..

# 4. Initialize with staged outcomes and push to shared repository
/vybe:init "Your project description"
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize project with Vybe framework"
git push origin main

# 5. Team members clone and set their roles
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
export VYBE_MEMBER=dev-1  # Each member uses dev-1, dev-2, etc.
```

### Add to Existing Project
```bash
# In your existing project directory
git clone https://github.com/iptracej-education/vybe.git vybe-framework
cp -r vybe-framework/.claude .
rm -rf vybe-framework

# Initialize Vybe in your existing project
/vybe:init "Your existing project description"
```

**Framework Repository**: [https://github.com/iptracej-education/vybe](https://github.com/iptracej-education/vybe)

**Repository Requirements**:
- **Solo development**: Local git repo only (no GitHub needed)
- **Multi-member teams**: **GitHub repository required** for coordination
  - Vybe uses git-based coordination between team members
  - Create your GitHub repository before setup for team projects

## Start Building

```bash
# 1. Initialize with staged outcomes (done during setup)
/vybe:init "COVID data visualization dashboard"
# Captures: 
# - First minimal outcome: "Show COVID numbers on webpage"
# - Final vision: "Real-time dashboard with visualizations"
# - Initial stages: Show data â†’ Add layout â†’ Add charts â†’ Make real-time

# 2. Create outcome-grouped backlog
/vybe:backlog init --auto

# 3. Work on current stage
/vybe:execute fetch-api-data    # Stage 1 tasks
/vybe:execute display-numbers

# 4. Complete stage and advance
/vybe:release                   # Marks Stage 1 complete, advances to Stage 2

# 5. Check progress and outcomes
/vybe:status outcomes          # See stage progression
/vybe:status                   # Overall progress

# 6. Code-Reality Analysis (ðŸ”¥ POWERFUL NEW FEATURES)
/vybe:discuss "reshape this project to fit 2 weeks, prefer MVP, keep security"
# â†’ Automatically runs: /vybe:audit mvp-extraction --timeline=14days + scope-drift
# â†’ Provides specific recommendations based on YOUR actual code

/vybe:discuss "find features not tied to business outcomes"  
# â†’ Automatically runs: /vybe:audit business-value
# â†’ Maps YOUR implemented features to YOUR business outcomes

/vybe:discuss "our README is outdated, sync with actual features"
# â†’ Automatically runs: /vybe:audit documentation + code-reality
# â†’ Compares YOUR README with YOUR actual source code

# 7. Direct audit commands (for CI/automation)
/vybe:audit code-reality           # Compare docs vs actual implementation
/vybe:audit scope-drift            # Detect feature creep beyond original vision
/vybe:audit mvp-extraction         # Extract minimal viable scope

# 8. Team coordination (optional)
/vybe:backlog member-count 2
export VYBE_MEMBER=dev-1
/vybe:backlog assign stage-2 dev-2
```

## Supported Programming Languages

The vybe framework is **language-agnostic** and intelligently adapts to any programming language by reading the technology registry. The framework automatically detects and uses the appropriate tools for each language:

### âœ… **Fully Supported Languages**

| Language | Package Managers | Test Frameworks | Build Tools | Server/Runtime |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Python** | uv, poetry, pip | pytest, unittest | setuptools, poetry build | uvicorn, gunicorn |
| **JavaScript/Node.js** | npm, yarn, pnpm | jest, mocha, vitest | webpack, vite, rollup | node, nodemon |
| **TypeScript** | npm, deno, bun | jest, vitest, deno test | tsc, vite, turbo | node, deno, bun |
| **C/C++** | make, cmake, conan | gtest, catch2, ctest | make, cmake, ninja | direct execution |
| **Go** | go mod | go test | go build | go run |
| **Ruby** | bundler, gem | rspec, minitest | rake | ruby, rails server |
| **R** | renv, CRAN | testthat | R CMD build | Rscript |
| **Rust** | cargo | cargo test | cargo build | cargo run |
| **Java** | maven, gradle | junit, testng | maven, gradle | java, spring boot |
| **C#/.NET** | dotnet, nuget | xunit, nunit | dotnet build | dotnet run |

### ðŸ”§ **How Language Detection Works**

1. **Template Analysis**: When importing templates, vybe intelligently analyzes:
   - Package manager files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.)
   - Build configurations (`Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `build.gradle`, etc.)
   - Test directories and frameworks
   - Server/runtime configurations

2. **Technology Registry Creation**: Creates language-specific `.vybe/tech/languages.yml`:
   ```yaml
   # Example for Python with uv
   language:
     name: Python
     version: "3.12"
   
   execution:
     run: "uv run python {file}"
     interactive: "uv run python"
   
   package_manager:
     name: uv
     install_deps: "uv pip install -e ."
     add_package: "uv add {package}"
   
   testing:
     run_tests: "uv run python -m pytest"
   ```

3. **Universal Execution**: All vybe commands read this registry and use the appropriate tools:
   - **Python project**: Uses `uv run python`, `uv add`, `uv run pytest`
   - **Node.js project**: Uses `node`, `npm install`, `npm test`
   - **Go project**: Uses `go run`, `go get`, `go test`
   - **C++ project**: Uses `g++`, `make`, `make test`

### ðŸš€ **Adding New Languages**

The framework easily supports new languages by creating appropriate technology registries:

```yaml
# Example: Swift
language:
  name: Swift

execution:
  run: "swift {file}"
  build_and_run: "swift run"

package_manager:
  name: swift
  install_deps: "swift package resolve"
  add_package: "swift package add {package}"

testing:
  run_tests: "swift test"

build:
  build_cmd: "swift build"
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Language-Agnostic Features**

- **Template Import**: Works with templates in any language
- **Code Generation**: Follows language-specific patterns and conventions
- **Testing**: Uses appropriate test frameworks automatically
- **Dependency Management**: Uses correct package managers
- **Build & Run**: Executes using proper language tools
- **Multi-Language Projects**: Supports polyglot projects with multiple languages

**Platform support**: Linux, macOS, WSL2, Git Bash (not Windows CMD)
