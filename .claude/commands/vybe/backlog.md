# /vybe:backlog - Strategic Feature Management

Intelligent backlog management with automated analysis, grooming, and planning capabilities.

## Usage
```bash
/vybe:backlog [action] [options]
```

## Actions & Automation Levels
- **Default**: Display current backlog with status
- **init [--auto]**: AI feature discovery (interactive vs automated)
- **add [feature] [--auto]**: Add features (manual vs AI-suggested batch)
- **groom [--auto]**: Clean backlog (interactive vs automated RICE/WSJF)
- **release [version]**: Group features into releases
- **dependencies**: Map cross-feature dependencies  
- **capacity**: Estimate effort and sprint planning
- **member-count [N]**: Configure project with N developers (1-5 max, creates dev-1, dev-2, etc.)
- **assign [feature] [dev-N]**: Assign feature to specific member (dev-1, dev-2, dev-3, dev-4, or dev-5)

## Global Options
- **--auto**: Automated mode - AI makes decisions without user confirmation
- **--interactive**: Interactive mode - AI asks for approval (default behavior)

## Platform Compatibility
- [OK] Linux, macOS, WSL2, Git Bash
- [NO] Native Windows CMD/PowerShell

## Pre-Backlog Checks

### Project Status
- Vybe initialized: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/project" ] && echo "[OK] Project ready" || echo "[NO] Run /vybe:init first"'`
- Backlog exists: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && echo "[OK] Backlog found" || echo "[SETUP] Use /vybe:backlog init for setup"'`
- Features count: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/features" ] && ls -d .vybe/features/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} features planned" || echo "0 features planned"'`
- Members configured: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep -q "^## Members:" .vybe/backlog.md && echo "[OK] Members configured" || echo "[INFO] No members configured"'`

### Automation Check
- Auto mode: `bash -c '[[ "$*" == *"--auto"* ]] && echo "[AUTO] Automated mode enabled" || echo "[MANUAL] Interactive mode (default)"'`

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Context Loading

### Task 0: Load Complete Project Context (MANDATORY)
```bash
echo "[CONTEXT] LOADING PROJECT CONTEXT"
echo "=========================="
echo ""

# Validate project exists
if [ ! -d ".vybe/project" ]; then
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL ERROR: Project not initialized"
    echo "   Cannot manage backlog without project context."
    echo "   Run /vybe:init first to establish project foundation."
    exit 1
fi

# CRITICAL: Load ALL project documents - NEVER skip this step
project_loaded=false

echo "[LOADING] Loading project foundation documents..."

# Load overview (business context, goals, constraints)
if [ -f ".vybe/project/overview.md" ]; then
    echo "[OK] Loaded: overview.md (business goals, users, constraints)"
    # AI MUST read and understand project context
else
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL ERROR: overview.md missing"
    echo "   Run /vybe:init to create missing project documents"
    exit 1
fi

# Load architecture (technical decisions, patterns)
if [ -f ".vybe/project/architecture.md" ]; then
    echo "[OK] Loaded: architecture.md (tech stack, patterns, decisions)"
    # AI MUST read and understand technical constraints
else
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL ERROR: architecture.md missing"
    echo "   Run /vybe:init to create missing project documents"
    exit 1
fi

# Load conventions (coding standards, practices)
if [ -f ".vybe/project/conventions.md" ]; then
    echo "[OK] Loaded: conventions.md (standards, patterns, practices)"
    # AI MUST read and understand coding standards
else
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL ERROR: conventions.md missing"
    echo "   Run /vybe:init to create missing project documents"
    exit 1
fi

# Load any custom project documents
for doc in .vybe/project/*.md; do
    if [ -f "$doc" ] && [[ ! "$doc" =~ (overview|architecture|conventions) ]]; then
        echo "[OK] Loaded: $(basename "$doc") (custom project context)"
    fi
done

echo ""

## Additional Actions

### Release Planning, Dependencies, Capacity
```bash
# These remain the same as previously implemented
# Just ensuring --auto flag compatibility where applicable
```

## Error Handling & AI Guidelines

### Automation Safety
- **Backup before changes**: Always create .backup file
- **Validate inputs**: Check file integrity before processing
- **Rollback capability**: Provide undo functionality
- **Change tracking**: Log what automated changes were made

### RICE Scoring Logic
- **Reach**: Estimated users affected (1-5 scale)
- **Impact**: Value delivered per user (1-5 scale)  
- **Confidence**: Certainty in estimates (1-5 scale)
- **Effort**: Development time needed (1-5 scale)
- **RICE = (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort**

### WSJF Scoring Logic  
- **Business Value**: Revenue/user impact (1-10)
- **Time Criticality**: Urgency factor (1-10)
- **Risk Reduction**: Risk mitigation value (1-10)
- **Job Size**: Development effort (1-10)
- **WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size**

## Success Output

### Interactive Mode
```
[OK] Interactive backlog grooming complete!

[STATS] Review Summary:
   * Duplicates reviewed: 3 groups
   * Items scored: 8 features
   * Priority changes: 2 features moved
   * User decisions: All approved

[ACTIONS] Next: /vybe:plan [top-priority-feature]
```

### Automated Mode  
```
[AUTO] Automated grooming complete!

[STATS] Optimizations Applied:
   * Merged 3 duplicate features -> 1 comprehensive feature
   * Scored 12 unscored items with RICE/WSJF
   * Reordered 15 items by value delivery priority
   * Removed 2 empty sections

[ACTIONS] Backlog optimized for maximum value delivery
   Top feature: user-authentication-system (WSJF: 9.0)

[SAVE] Backup: .vybe/backlog.md.backup
```

This implementation gives users complete control over automation level while maintaining the power of AI-driven optimization.
